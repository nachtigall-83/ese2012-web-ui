Explain how a typical HTTP request is processed with the framework (the request lifecycle)
First the browser translates the URL to an IP address if it does already know it. If it does not know it, it contacts a DNS server to resolve the name.
Then browser will open a TCP connection to the IP address of the URL and send a HTTP GET request over. 
The server software will get this HTTP request. It will somehow generate a HTTP response and send that back trough the TCP connection.
When the browser gets the response, it typically renders it on screen. 


Why should GET requests be idempotent?
Because GET requests should not modify anything on the server. They should only show the content.

Where should you format data for rendering?
It should be as late as possible.
